# KAAVISH-I
This is the project repository of Kaavish I for the project of FUNCODER which is an augmented reality based application to help teach programming concepts.

# Motivation:
Learning programming has always been a challenging task. Even some college students find difficulties in grasping the basic concepts of programming. This happens when an individual lacks with problem solving, and cognitive skills. Some statistics proved that student face problems in writing, reading, as well as designing a simple programming code.

This causes students to develop an attitude to depend on their peers to complete their tasks assigned in their schools. They lose interest and become indolent, expecting sympathy marks from lecturer.

In this project, we develop a mobile application which uses gamification and augmented reality to make understanding of programming and computer science concepts, easier for students, so that they can develop their interest in computer science fields.




The project has 3 components to it:

1- The Game Development Component which consists of working with Unity using C# scripting.

2- The second component consists of integrating Augment Reality for image tracking in order to detect the cards and generate real time code.

3- The third component of the project is about generating a language using Compiler Construction.

The parts are divided among the project partners Aiman Hasan, Hamza Masroor and Hasan Rizvi respectively.
